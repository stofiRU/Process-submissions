Write a function parse_submissions(directory) that takes as a parameter a single string, the location of the submissions folder (i.e. the folder containing all the submissions). The function should return a list of tuples, each of them corresponding to a submission in the submissions directory. Each tuple contains two strings, the username of the student that owns the submission (which is specified in the Team field in the data.tcl file) and the name of the problem the submission belongs to (specified in the Problem field). The tuples should be sorted in ascending order by submission date (specified in the Date field). And finally, all submissions that do not have Accepted in the Classify field should be filtered out.:
